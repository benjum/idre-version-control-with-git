# Version Control with Git
  
This repository is maintained by Ben Winjum for use in UCLA IDRE's introductory training class on Version Control with Git.

## Slides

* The slides are available in the file "Version Control with Git.pdf"

## Interacting with JupyterHub for class

This is not required -- all you need for the class is Git, a shell, and a text editor, so interacting with JupyterHub is not strictly necessary.  However, if you will find it convenient and/or would like to mirror the class demos:

* UCLA participants (multi-factor authentication required):

  * <a href="https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/">Go to IDRE's JupyterHub</a>

* Non UCLA participants:
  * [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benjum/idre-version-control-with-git/master)
